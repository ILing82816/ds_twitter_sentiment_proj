2250,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,Imagine thinking sleepy joe can prevent natural disasters
2251,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,Not as bad as you backing a confederate flag.

2254,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,Next year will be BIG because you won't be in office.
2255,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00, Extensive? Verifiable? What do you base that on? The fact that some biased left wing writer was published in WaPo? 
2256,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,"Why? If they do, you'll still call them thugs and send your henchmen in to kidnap them. How about you focus on YOUR job. Shit is falling apart on your watch."
2257,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,"No one wants to hear from a Sexual Predator~you knew, DID NOTHING!! Just like you know the predator Trump is, and DO NOTHING!"

2261,2020-09-14 23:56:09+00:00,How about Joe Biden challenging Trump to actual fight? I will GUARANTEE Donald Trump wouldn’t want any part of that.
2262,2020-09-14 23:56:08+00:00,

2265,2020-09-14 23:56:08+00:00,Joe is further left than both Hillary and Biden. He just happens to care about this country and it’s people so he gravitated to more populist candidates like Sanders and later Trump

2267,2020-09-14 23:56:08+00:00,But not Joe Biden’s? Your assertion that a career politician doesn’t lie displays just how naive you truly are
